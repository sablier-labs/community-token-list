# Sablier Community Token List

To add your token to the list, submit a request by
[creating a GitHub issue](https://github.com/sablierhq/default-token-list/issues/new?assignees=&labels=token+request&template=token-request.md&title=Add+%7BTOKEN_SYMBOL%7D%3A+%7BTOKEN_NAME%7D).

## Disclaimer

Filing an issue does not guarantee addition to the default token list.

We do not review token addition requests in any particular order, and we do not guarantee that your request will be
accepted.
